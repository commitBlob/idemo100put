  <h4>Croatian in 5 minutes</h4>
  <p>Croatian language is one of the hardest languages to learn as it has fairly complex grammar and word
    pronunciation.</p>
  <p>What makes Croatian even more difficult is the variety of slangs and dialects. For example Dubrovnik has it's own
    language (Dubrovaćki).
    Some Dubrovaćke words differ from Croatian and other Croatians might have hard time understanding everything.
    If you speak Dubrovaćki to other Croatian they might have hard time understanding everything.</p>
